The project Digital Alarm Clock is built using Arduino Board using C language concepts. In this project we allow user to set or adjust time for alarm using the 3 push input buttons which helps user to turn on the alarm clock, adjust the time for alarm and also to turn off the clock and use it as a normal clock. When alarm time is equal to the current time the Arduino starts producing a sound to indicate the alarm time, we can turn off the alarm or we can also snooze it, so that it rings again after some particular time interval. 
	The C concepts like variables with appropriate data types, constants, arrays, functions, control statements, if else ladders, loops, enumerations are used for making more reliable, interactive project. Libraries are used to handle the display, buttons, alarm of the Digital Alarm clock.
